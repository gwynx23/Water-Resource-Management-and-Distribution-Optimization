# Water-Resource-Management-and-Distribution-Optimization

Description
Efficient water distribution is crucial for ensuring equitable access to water resources across Matalom, particularly during dry seasons. Traditional methods of managing water supply face challenges such as uneven distribution, high operational costs, and resource wastage. This project uses graph theory and Dijkstra's Algorithm with a priority queue (min-heap) to optimize water distribution.

The system models water sources and barangays as nodes in a graph, with pipelines represented as weighted edges. This method ensures efficient and cost-effective water distribution.

Project Structure

This project contains two Python scripts:
code.py: Implements the core water distribution optimization logic using Dijkstra's Algorithm.
visual.py: Visualizes the water distribution network graphically.

Requirements

The project requires Python and the following libraries:
networkx
matplotlib
These libraries can be easily installed using pip.

Installation
Clone the repository or copy the code files to your local machine.

Install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install networkx matplotlib

Run on Google Colab: To run the code, follow these steps:

Open Google Colab.
Copy and paste the contents of code.py into one code cell and run it.
Copy and paste the contents of visual.py into another code cell and run it.

Usage
Running code.py
This script contains the logic for water distribution optimization using Dijkstra's algorithm.
Copy-paste the contents into a code cell in Google Colab and run it.

Running visual.py
This script generates a visual representation of the water distribution network.
Copy-paste the contents into a code cell in Google Colab and run it to visualize the graph.
